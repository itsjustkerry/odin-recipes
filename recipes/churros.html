    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
    <p>Churros are a Spanish or Mexican pastry, a bit like a donut or cruller, and are made from deep-fried unsweetened dough and then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. </p>
    <p>Who doesn't enjoy a dessert that can be dipped in hot chocolate, am I right?</p>

    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <p>To make this delightful desert, you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups water</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 packed tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter for brushing on before sugaring.</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <p>For the cinammon sugar, you'll need:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>

    <h4><em>Steps</em></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, butter, brown sugar, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add flour all at once and cook, stirring, until a soft, sticky dough ball forms, and a starchy film coats the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking for about one minute more then transfer to a bowl and let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in vanilla extract and eggs, 1 at a time, and mix in using a spatula</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with silpat mats or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Pipe out 3 to 4 inch ropes onto the prepared baking sheets, spaced a few inches apart</li>
        <li>Spray tops of the churros with vegetable oil spray, and then spray water generously all over the pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until churros are puffed and the edges are browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Turn off the oven, and open the door for about 10 seconds to vent heat. Close the door, leaving it open about 8 to 12 inches, and let churros rest in the oven for 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, and working in batches of 6 at a time, brush them lightly with melted butter, and then toss to coat in a bag of cinnamon sugar.</li>
        <li>Enjoy with hot chocolate or tea.</li>
    </ol>
